<h2>Feature Ideas</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        User provides different payments and calculator says how much faster
        you'll pay off the loan, and how much you'll save in interest while
        doing so. Calculator could even auto-generate the payment examples.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add minimum payment field. Change "desired payment" to "total payment".
        Subtract minimum from payment then compute distribution with remainder.
        This will clarify its presentation, despite adding a bit of input.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a button to apply the current payment, updating the loans, and
        calculating how the next payment should be distributed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a "clear" button to wipe the page and localStorage.
    </li>
</ul>
