        <p>Debt is common, confusing, and expensive. When you're faced with several forms of debt it can be overwhelming. Many are forced to make the minimum payment until their loans reach maturity, but when they do have the opportunity to pay their debt down faster, the savings are generally significant and worth considering. The goal should be to minimize the amount of total interest that's generated over the course of your loans. That will result in the most savings, because the less interest that has generated, the less you've had to pay back in addition to what you initially borrowed.</p>

        <p>With this in mind, you have to figure out how to focus your extra payments so that the interest generated is minimized. With a mortgage and a credit card, this isn't very difficult to figure out, but what about when you have multiple loans with slightly different interest rates and similar balances? Student debt comes to mind, as it's common to end up with 6 or more different loans by the time you graduate. Consolidation is an option, but not always the best one. This brings you to figuring out where to put your extra payments. The math isn't particularly difficult, but you have to recalculate it from scratch every time your balance changes. This gets very old very quickly. From that, these loan calculators were created.</p>
